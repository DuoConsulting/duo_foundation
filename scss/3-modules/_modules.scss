// Modules
//
// Modules can consist of similar and/or disparate components. For example, a
// masthead might consist of a logo, navigation, and search form, while a
// “product grid” might consist of the same product info component repeated over
// and over.
//
// This directory might also contain partials for things like views, blocks,
// and/or sidebars.
